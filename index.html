                  Titus Oates was an English priest who was responsible for fabricating the story of a Catholic conspiracy to kill King Charles II which had enormous ramifications and lead to the loss of life of many innocent Jesuits.

                  Titus Oates was a renegade who had joined the Church after Cambridge University but was dismissed from his post for drunken blasphemy. He became the chaplain for a Royal Naval ship, the ‘Adventurer’, but he was dismissed from this as well.

                  To get some elevation in society after his fall from grace, it seems that Oates discovered a plot to kill the king – what became known as the ‘Popish Plot’. This was a plot ‘uncovered’ by Oates after he managed to infiltrate Jesuits based in London. The plan was to kill the king, Charles II, and replace him with his Catholic brother James. Then thousands of Protestants would be killed in a blood bath.

                  Oates gave, under oath, an account of what he had found out from the Jesuits. This account was made to a magistrate called Sir Edmund Geoffrey. He was found murdered in London a while after Oates had given his statement. This only served to heighten tension as many blamed the Catholics for taking their revenge out on a man who was only doing his job.
In September, Oates named many Catholics as being part of the conspiracy. Charles II treated his claims with huge scepticism but Parliament latched on to them and argued that they should be investigated. Oates was given a state apartment in Whitehall and an annual allowance of £1,200.

                There was great fear in Britain at the time of Catholic intrigue and a very real apprehension that on
                the death of Charles his Roman Catholic brother, James, would be placed on the throne. Prints were used
                to fuel public anxiety, and playing cards were another ideal means of spreading political propaganda at
                a low cost. Many packs were designed and engraved by leading artists of the day.
